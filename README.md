> I tried to $emit data from 'Main' Single file component by using Global event bus, and read it in another Single file component/route called 'Help'. But while emitted data is registered in the <root> and shown in 'Main' component, I cannot display it in 'Help' component.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
